# K_Nearest_Neighbour_KNN_algorithm

Build a Machine Learning Model using K_Nearest_neighbor classifier 
first import the all necessary libraries
load Data using Pandas 
then assign the values of x and y for training and testing data
train and test data using model selection
devide data into training and testing format like nearly about 30% of data takes for testing purpose 
scale the training and testing data using Standar Scalar
build a K_Nearest Neighbour Model 
fit the training data into it 
and make prediction 
then find accuracy score ,confusion matrix and classification report of model 
finally visualization of testing and predicted data using Matplotlib.
